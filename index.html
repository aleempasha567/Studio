        <h2>Major in Direction and Script Writing</h2>
        <p>Every film starts with a script and script writing is not just telling stories. It involves the ability to
          tell a story in a way that can be visually captured. A good script has an emotional core - something that is
          important to the author and the audience is able to relate to. Good writing involves an imagination to think
          of unique narratives, the skill to capture the conflict, and the ability to hold the interest and curiosity of
          the audience.</p>

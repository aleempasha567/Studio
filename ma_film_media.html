          <h2>Major in Direction and Script Writing</h2>
          <p>Give Form to Your Own Idea. A screenplay forms the blueprint- it is the stage after which all other aspects
            of filmmaking come into being. While the script determines the logical outline, it is the Director who gives
            it the required form. <br><br> This program is best suited for Students who have strong writing skills, are
            aspiring to be independent filmmakers and are keen to learn the nuances of filmmaking process; specifically
            the key elements of impactful scriptwriting required for Films, Television and other Media Platforms.
            <br><br>This learning when blended with formal training in Film & Media Direction helps students to truly
            write and make a Film of their choice.</p>

          <h2>Major in Direction and Production</h2>
          <p>A Producer is the one who oversees film production. He/ she is involved in all stages of the film project â€“
            conceptualisation to execution. Typically, producer manages the business side of the film project; while the
            director manages the creative side.<br><br> Most Filmmakers today don many hats by working in different
            departments. For example, it is entirely possible that a person who has specialised in Production, starts off
            on a project as an Assistant Director. Hence, the learning of skills associated with both Direction and
            Production- across the gamut of Film, Television and Digital Media gives our students a strong foundation.</p>
